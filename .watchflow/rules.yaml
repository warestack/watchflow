rules:
- key: require_linked_issue
  name: Require Linked Issue
  description: Block PRs without issue references to ensure traceability and context
    for changes.
  severity: high
  category: quality
  reasoning: The repository has an 85% unlinked issue rate, indicating most PRs lack
    issue references which risks poor traceability and drive-by contributions.
- key: required_workflows
  name: Require CI Workflow Pass
  description: Ensure all PRs pass CI workflows before merging to maintain code quality
    and prevent regressions.
  severity: medium
  category: quality
  reasoning: The repository has established CI/CD workflows, so enforcing passing
    CI before merge helps maintain quality and governance.
- key: title_pattern
  name: Enforce Conventional Commit Titles
  description: Require PR titles to follow Conventional Commit patterns (feat:, fix:,
    etc.) for better changelog generation and clarity.
  severity: medium
  category: quality
  reasoning: No explicit mention of commit message standards; enforcing title patterns
    improves commit hygiene and project governance.
