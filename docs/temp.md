Here's a glossary-style documentation file based on the PDFs you provided, aligning terminology and concepts used across both the **Watchflow** brief and the **Agentic DevOps White Paper**. You can share this with your team to align while drafting documentation and README files.

# Watchflow Glossary & Core Concepts

### General Vision

| Term               | Definition                                                                                                                                                          |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Watchflow**      | An open-source tool for real-time governance of DevOps operations (PRs, workflows, deployments). It serves as the core of Warestack’s agentic protection engine.    |
| **Agentic DevOps** | A governance model where DevOps decisions are made dynamically and contextually by smart agents, not static rules. Inspired by the way Grammarly adapts to writing. |
| **Warestack**      | The commercial SaaS tool built on top of Watchflow, providing enterprise-level dashboards, AI-driven rules, and integrations with GitHub, Slack, and Linear.        |

### Problem Framing

| Term                        | Description                                                                                                                         |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Static Protection Rules** | Traditional `config-as-code` logic (e.g., YAML-defined CI/CD checks) which are binary, hardcoded, and unaware of real-time context. |
| **Config-as-Code**          | DevOps protection strategy using declarative YAML/JSON files—fast and predictable but lacks adaptability.                           |
| **Rule Drift**              | The phenomenon where governance logic becomes outdated or inconsistent across multiple services/repos.                              |
| **Siloed Signals**          | Lack of integration between development signals (e.g., PRs), communication tools (Slack), and tracking tools (Linear).              |
| **Manual Enforcement**      | Developers or DevOps engineers are responsible for checking and applying rules, which is time-consuming and error-prone.            |

### Watchflow Solution Components

| Term                    | Description                                                                                                                     |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Grammar for DevOps**  | Human-readable rules written in plain English that define “how changes should happen.” Similar to writing grammar in Grammarly. |
| **Context-Aware Rules** | Rules that adapt based on dynamic attributes such as urgency, role (e.g., senior engineer), commit size, day/time, etc.         |
| **Dynamic Rule Engine** | Engine that listens to GitHub events and applies context-based actions (block, comment, alert) in real time.                    |
| **Trace, Flag, Block**  | Lifecycle actions applied to risky operations: continuously monitor, flag anomalies, and optionally block violations.           |
| **Agentic Detection**   | AI-assisted logic that observes behavioral patterns, PR content, and metadata to uncover subtle or complex rule breaches.       |
| **Justified Actions**   | Each enforcement decision is made with clear context-aware explanation for developer trust and auditability.                    |

### Rules & Use Cases

| Term                          | Example / Notes                                                                                         |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Protection Rule**           | "Require 2 approvals for PRs to `main` unless it's a hotfix by a senior engineer on-call."              |
| **Rule Adaptation**           | Instead of `true/false`, Watchflow interprets developer roles and repo urgency to decide actions.       |
| **Examples of Agentic Rules** | Stop self-approval, require issue links, ensure PR description clarity, enforce based on day/time/role. |
| **Hybrid Architecture**       | Combines real-time event processing (webhooks) with AI rule reasoning and static fallback logic.        |

### Results from Evaluations

| Metric                  | Result                                                                                                           |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Violation Coverage**  | 92% of violations caught (vs. \~13% with static rules).                                                          |
| **Precision**           | 87% precision in detection—minimizing false positives.                                                           |
| **Coverage Gain**       | Agentic system detected up to **7×** more issues than config-based rules in projects like Terraform, Kubernetes. |
| **Justified Decisions** | 89% of actions came with a clear rationale, aiding in audit trails and developer adoption.                       |

### Integration Targets

| Platform            | Purpose                                                                        |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **GitHub**          | Primary source of PR and deployment events.                                    |
| **CI/CD Workflows** | Watchflow integrates at the protection rule level, not as a step in pipelines. |

### Evaluation Benchmarks

| Repositories Used   |
|---------------------|
| Microsoft VSCode    |
| Facebook React      |
| HashiCorp Terraform |
| PyTorch             |
| Kubernetes          |

100 PRs were analyzed using both static and agentic methods. Watchflow consistently surfaced more relevant violations.
